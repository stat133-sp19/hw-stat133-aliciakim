## Overview of Binomial Distribution

### bin_choose()

Calculate the number of combinations in which _k_ successes can occur in _n_ trials using bin_choose().

Note that k can be a range.

```{r}
bin_choose(n=5, k=2)
bin_choose(n=5, k=1:3)
```

### bin_probability()

Calculate the probability of getting a number of successes in a certain amount of trials with a specified probability of success (in decimal form).
```{r}
bin_probability(trials = 5, success = 2, prob = 0.1)

bin_probability(trials=5, success = 1:3, prob = 0.5)

```


### bin_distribution

Outputs a dataframe with primary class _bindis_.  This dataframe has one column for successes and one for probability.

```{r}
bin_distribution(trials=5, prob=0.5)
```

You can also plot this dataframe.

```{r}
dis1 <- bin_distribution(trials=5, prob=0.5)
plot(dis1)
```

### bin_cumulative

Outputs a dataframe with primary class _bincum_.  This dataframe has one column for successes and one for probability, just like bin_distribution.  It also has a column for cumulative probability of successes.

```{r}
bin_cumulative(trials=5, prob=0.5)
```

You can also plot this dataframe.

```{r}
dis2 <- bin_cumulative(trials=5, prob=0.5)
plot(dis2)
```

### bin_variable

Outputs an object of class _binvar_, which is a list with named elements, trials and prob.  Trials is number of trials and prob is the probability of success.

```{r}
bin1 <- bin_variable(trials=10, p=0.3)
bin1
```


Besides seeing _binvar_ parameters, you can also obtain summary measures for this object.

Calling summary.binvar() returns an object of class _summary.binvar_ which is a list of elements, trials, prob, mean, variance, mode, skewness, and kurtosis.

```{r}
bin1 <- bin_variable(trials=10, p=0.3)
binsum1 <- summary(bin1)
binsum1
```

### Functions of Measure

Without creating a new object, these functions let you calculate summary measurements given just trials and probability arguments.

Mean: the expected value of the binomial distribution. _np_
    bin_mean(trials, prob) 
Variance: _np(1-p)_.  STD is simply square root of this variance.
    bin_variance(trials, prob)
Mode: most likely number of successes in n trials with a certain probability. It is equal to the greater integer less than or equal to _np+p_
    bin_mode(trials, prob)
Skewness: Measure the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a random variable about its mean.  Can be positive, negative, or undefined.  _(1-2p) / STD _
    bin_skewness(trials, prob)
Kurtosis: Measure of the "tailedness" of the probability distribution of a random variable.  _(1-6p)(1-p)/ variance_
    bin_kurtosis(trials, prob)
    
```{r}
bin_mean(10,0.3)
bin_variance(10,0.3)
bin_mode(10,0.3)
bin_skewness(10,0.3)
bin_kurtosis(10,0.3)
```
